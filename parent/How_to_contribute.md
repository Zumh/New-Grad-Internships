<summary><b>Table Example</b> -- click here</summary> <br>

- If you were **ADDING** a job opening for *Walmart*:

| Company Name | Location | Roles | Employment | Date Added (mm/dd/yyyy) |
| ------------ | -------- | ----- | -----------| -------- |------------------------ |
| [Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/careers) | - New York, NY <br> - Chicago, IL | ✅ [New Grad Quant Trader](https://www.citadel.com/careers)| Fulltime | 10/01/2023 |t


Placeholders for the table are defined as follows:
  - `Company Name`: Represents the name of the company.
  - `Location`: Denotes the place(s) where the job position is available.
    - When there are multiple locations, each location should be prefixed with a dash `-`, and a `<br>` tag should be inserted before each location, starting from the second location.
    - Example: `- {location1} <br> - {location2}`
  - `Roles`: Refers to any additional roles or links to the job posting.
    - Including "✅" is optional, but if you want to maintain consistency with the rest of the repository, you can add it at the beginning of the role listing.
  - `Employment`:  Either fulltime, part-time, or internships 
  - `Date Added`: Specifies the date when the job opening was added to the repository. The date should be in the format `mm/dd/yyyy`.
    - This helps in keeping the most recent job openings at the top of the table.


```java
| [Company Name](link-to-job-posting) | Location (s)  | [Position Name](link-to-job-posting)| Employment Type | mm/dd/yyyy |
```

<br>

- If **UPDATING** a job opening, please follow the same format as above, but replace the link to the job posting with the new link, or add a new position name separated by a `<br>` tag.

| Company Name | Location | Roles | Employment | Date Added <br> mm/dd/yyyy |
| ------------ | -------- | ----- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| [Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/careers) | - New York, NY <br> - Chicago, IL | ✅ [New Grad Quant Trader](https://www.citadel.com/careers)| Fulltime | 10/01/2023 |t

### Removing A Job Opening

This section is for removing a job opening from the table in the `All-Jobs.md` file.
It's very similar, assuming you have already forked the repository and cloned it to your local machine.
Ensure you remove it from the corresponding category file (`SWE-Jobs.md`, `Quant-Jobs.md`, `Data-Science-Jobs.md`)

1. **Find the Job Opening**: Find the job opening you want to remove from the table in the `All-Jobs.md` file.

2. **Close the Job Opening**: 
    - Simply add a `🔒` before the Roles or links to the job posting. (Be mindful of the space)
    - Then remove the link to the job posting from both the company name and position name. *The parentheses should be empty*

<details>
<summary><b>Table Example</b></summary><br>

- This is what the *table* would look like if you were removing a job opening for *Walmart*:

| Company Name | Location | Roles | Employment | Date Added (mm/dd/yyyy) |
| ------------ | -------- | ----- | -----------| -------- |------------------------ |
| [Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/careers) | - New York, NY <br> - Chicago, IL | 🔒 [New Grad Quant Trader](https://www.citadel.com/careers)| Fulltime | 10/01/2023 |t


Placeholders for the table are as follows:
  - `Company Name`: The name of the company.
  - `Location`: The location(s) of the job opening.
  - `Roles`: Any additional Roles or links to the job posting.

```java
| [Company Name]() | - Location (s)  | 🔒 [Position Name]()| - | mm/dd/yyyy |
```

</details>

If the job opening has multiple roles, and you want to close one or more:
1. Repeat the same steps as above, but only add `🔒` to the roles you want to close.
- If you want to close all the roles, then add `🔒` to all the roles.
- If you want to close some of the roles, then add `🔒` to the roles you want to close while separating them with a `<br>` tag.
1. Move the closed job opening to the bottom of the company's list of job openings.
2. Add `<br><br>` if it doesn't already exist between the open and closed job roles.

<details>
<summary><b>Multiple Roles: Table Example</b></summary><br>

- This is what the *table* would look like if you were removing a job opening for *Walmart*:

| Company Name | Location | Roles | Employment | Date Added (mm/dd/yyyy) |

Placeholders for the table are as follows:
  - `Company Name`: The name of the company.
  - `Location`: The location(s) of the job opening.
  - `Roles`: Any additional Roles or links to the job posting.

```java
| [Company Name](link-to-job-posting) | - Location (s)  | ✅ [Position Name](link-to-job-posting) <br> ✅ [Position Name 2] <br><br> 🔒 [Position Name 3]() <br> 🔒 [Position Name 4]()| [Employment Type] | mm/dd/yyyy |
```

### Guidelines
